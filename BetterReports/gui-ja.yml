# Some buttons may have a type: parameter. This means that this button has an
#  action associated with it.
#
# Every button will have placeholders.
# These are the same as the ones in config.yml
#
# If you have PlaceholderAPI, you'll be able to use it. (see the placeholder section in config.yml)

    # It is not recommended to edit the buttons for this menu.
    # If you need help, please join our Discord server. (https://austech.dev/to/support)
